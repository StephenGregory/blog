Anna,

What has become a year has felt like a lifetime.

Coming from broken relationships, we discovered what real, effortless, love really is. As you have
said, we're like puzzle pieces that, through wear and tear, have been warped into pieces that now fit together.

You have reignited my love for crafting, fully realized my passion for music by exposing me to live
entertainment, and you pick up the controller to help me beat bosses when I’m gaming. 

You are an amazing, heartfelt, strong, and selfless human on this Earth. You give so much and do not expect
anything in return. Your students are so lucky to have you.

You embrace who I am. What more could I ask?

## We’ve had an insanely fun year

Fun facts:

- We have attended our first music festival and met some very talented artists
- We devoured the deliciousness that is Montreal eats
- We sat amongst the tall trees in Lynn Valley, Vancouver
- We have had a total of 3.5 excuses of fights
- We _experienced_ my favorite band, July Talk. This will be a night I will remember forever.
- Many flavors of ice cream have been consumed in the bonding of our relationship
- Mom and Dad have unoffically adopted another child (I'm pretty sure 
  [Sarah](https://twitter.com/KiddoWalsh) is part of the family now)

I can't find the words to truely express how I feel, so I'll keep it brief.

## In short:
 
#### You are the Ratchet to my Clank

I can’t wait to see what adventures this year brings. We're going to have a lot of fun. Now let's go grab some ice cream.
