Like all good tutorials on the web these days, I _must_ start off with my life story before I tell you what you've come here for.

I'm kidding. It's not that exciting.

We wanted to try to reducing our carbon footprint by replacing saran wrap with bees wax wraps. You can but the wraps, but they are pretty expensive. Wax is expensive, too, but you get more mileage.

1. Cut your fabric into appropriately sized rectangles.
2. Heat the oven 90 F.
3. Spread the wax over the fabric.

4. Wait for it to melt.
5. Use a stiff paintbrush to spread it along the fabric. It's cool if you need more wax to cover other areas.
6. After melting and dabbing:

7. You can hang it until it dries. Honestly, though, you can leave it anywhere.
